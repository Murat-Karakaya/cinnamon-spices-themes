# Nergis-Dark theme

Nergis is a [Material Design](https://material.io) theme made for Cinnamon desktop environment (often used by Linux Mint).
It is based on [Orchis-theme](https://github.com/vinceliuice/Orchis-theme)

## Why Nergis?

The reason why I built Nergis was because I found out that the original orchis theme had some limitations in cinnamon. Including:

* No theming in panel edit mode
* Not built for vertical panels
* No light panels
* Sound applet is broken (merged into orchis and got fixed)
* Workspace naming have bugs (merged into orchis and got fixed)
* Colors don't match the Mint-Y themes
* Window selectors don't match the theme color

That is why I decided create this fork with all of these changes including some new additions:

* window snapping preview now match the custom color
* New elements (toggle switches, workspace addition buttons, trash-icons, close button)
* More extensive use of the user selected colors. (like notifications submenu's).

It is helpful to know that most of these options are probably not in orchis on purpose. Hence, the fork.


## Installation

The easiest way to install the theme is to use the "Themes" application that comes with cinnamon.
